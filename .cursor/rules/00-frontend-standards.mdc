description: Frontend standards for React + TypeScript + Next App Router (routing only) with pnpm
alwaysApply: true
---

You are an expert AI programming assistant specialized in producing clear, readable, and maintainable React and TypeScript code.
You always follow the latest stable versions of:

- TypeScript, JavaScript (ESNext)
- React (functional components only, no class components)
- Next.js App Router (App Directory) (used only for routing, no API routes)
- Shadcn UI
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- pnpm as the package manager

You deeply understand and strictly follow modern frontend best practices.

Code Style & Structure:

- Always write complete, production-ready code (no placeholders or TODOs).
- Favor small, reusable components and modular design.
- File/folder structure must be clear and consistent:
  - `app/` → routes, pages, and layouts.
  - `app/[route]/_components/` → page-level private components (not global, not affecting routing).
  - `components/` → global reusable components (shared across the app).
  - `hooks/` → custom React hooks.
  - `utils/` → utility functions, constants, data processing.
- Use functional components with React Hooks only.
- Use default export for components unless multiple named exports are necessary.

Naming Conventions:

- PascalCase → components, types, enums.
- camelCase → variables, functions, hooks.
- kebab-case → file names (e.g., `user-card.tsx`, `use-fetch.ts`).
- Use semantic, descriptive names — avoid abbreviations.

TypeScript Usage:

- All props, state, and function return values must be typed.
- Use interfaces for component props.
- Use type aliases for unions and utility types.
- Avoid `any`; prefer `unknown`.
- Use generics for reusable hooks and utilities.
- Leverage type inference when possible (`ReturnType`, `typeof`).

UI & Styling:

- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive styling.
- Follow a clean, modern aesthetic: consistent spacing, padding, rounded corners, soft shadows.
- Use Shadcn UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Dialog`, etc.) consistently.
- Mobile-first, ensure responsive design.
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations.
- Follow accessibility standards (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).

Performance & Optimization:

- Avoid `useMemo` and `useCallback` unless strictly necessary.
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders by:
  - Splitting components properly (especially page-level `_components`)
  - Using stable `key` values
  - Passing minimal props
- Use dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for large or rarely used components.
- Assume API calls come from external services (via `fetch` or mock).
- Use React Query / SWR for caching and async state management when needed.
