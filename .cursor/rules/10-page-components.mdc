description: Page-level private component rules (applies to app/**/_components/**)
globs:
  - "app/**/_components/**"
---

For files under `app/**/_components/**`:

- Treat components as route-scoped, not global; prefer local composition over exporting to global `components/`.
- Keep props minimal and stable; move shared logic to `utils/` or global components when reused.
- Avoid `useMemo`/`useCallback` unless profiling justifies them; prefer splitting and simplifying.
- Ensure accessibility (roles, labels, keyboard navigation).
- Default export by default; use named exports only when multiple related exports are required.
