Use pnpm for all scripts. The project is always running; do not use `pnpm dev`.

Before considering work complete, ensure all pass:
1) `pnpm build`
2) `pnpm type-check`
3) `pnpm lint`
4) `pnpm format`

If script names differ in package.json, update them accordingly so these commands exist and succeed.
